# 🛡️ Core Functions of a Security Operations Center (SOC)

 🔔 What is a SOC?

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized unit comprised of cybersecurity professionals dedicated to **monitoring, detecting, investigating, and responding to cyber threats**. It serves as the frontline defense, operating around the clock to safeguard critical systems and data.

 🧠 Core Functional Pillars of a SOC

Below are five fundamental functions that drive the efficiency and effectiveness of any SOC:

🔎 1. **Security Monitoring**
- Provides continuous, real-time oversight of network, endpoint, application, and system activity.
- Detects suspicious behavior using tools like **SIEM**, **IDS/IPS**, **EDR**, and packet analysis solutions.
- Enables visibility into both internal and external threats.

**🔧 Tools:** Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar, Zeek, Suricata

🧪 2. **Incident Detection**
- Analyzes logs and telemetry to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Utilizes **correlation rules**, **threat intelligence**, and **behavior analytics** to spot attacks.
- Aims to reduce **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**.

**🧰 Includes:** Alert triaging, threat hunting, detection engineering

 🚨 3. **Incident Response**
- Initiates rapid actions when a threat is confirmed:
  - 🧯 Containment  
  - 🧹 Eradication  
  - 🔁 Recovery  
- Coordinates across departments for effective remediation and impact analysis.
- Documents incidents and lessons learned for continuous improvement.

**📘 Frameworks:** NIST IR Lifecycle, MITRE ATT&CK, SANS IR Process

📂 4. **Log Collection & Management**
- Ingests logs from diverse sources including:
  - 🌐 Firewalls  
  - 🖥️ Servers  
  - 💻 Endpoints  
  - ☁️ Cloud Platforms  
  - 🧩 Applications
- Normalizes and time-aligns logs for use in forensics and compliance.
- Secures data for legal, regulatory, and operational use.

**📡 Tools:** Syslog, Splunk UF, Filebeat, Winlogbeat, Fluentd

 🌐 5. **Threat Intelligence & Reporting**
- Integrates external and internal **Threat Intelligence Feeds (TI)** to enhance threat detection.
- Builds dashboards and generates reports for technical teams and executive stakeholders.
- Tracks key SOC metrics like:
  - ⏱️ Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)  
  - 🧯 Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)  
  - ⚠️ Alert Volumes and False Positive Rates

**🛠 Platforms:** STIX/TAXII, MISP, OpenCTI, TIPs

 🔄 SOC Operations Lifecycle

**[ Monitoring ] ➡ [ Detection ] ➡ [ Analysis ] ➡ [ Response ] ➡ [ Recovery ] ➡ [ Reporting ]**

This cycle ensures that threats are not just detected and mitigated but also analyzed, documented, and used to improve future resilience.
